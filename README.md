## Description

This project uses Python and Flask so the user can sign up and interact with other users on a technology news site through posts, comments, and votes.

## Installation

If you are using the application from the heroku deployed site, you are all set. If you would like to try it from local, you will need Python, Flask, SQLAlchemy, PyMySQL , bcrypt, and Gunicorn.

## Usage

When you first go to the site, it will bring you to a list of the posts created by users.

From there, click the login button in the top right corner of the page. Create an account for yourself using the signup if you are new, or login if you have an account already.

You will then be brought to the dashboard where you can create your own post.
